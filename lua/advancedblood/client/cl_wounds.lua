-- Wound records: the central wound model on the client.
-- Every projectile hit the server reports (abl_hit, sh_wound.lua) becomes one record. It holds what
-- is known about the event (projectile class, range, what was crossed, entry / exit relation) and
-- what ABL derives from it (tissue damage, hidden temporary-cavity factor, how the wound opens, what
-- is left on the skin around it), and it ties together everything that follows from the event:
--   * the marks on the body (cl_woundfx.lua: entry, exit or graze, drawn from the record),
--   * the wounds Z-City bleeds through (cl_emission.lua: its entry / exit / arterial records are
--     matched to the record, bleed from the visible openings and take their character from it),
--   * the first release of blood (E.OnHit),
--   * the wound's surface state over time: wet, clotting, drying (WS.Think).
-- Z-City remains the authority for anatomy, blood volume, pulse and death. Nothing here feeds back
-- into gameplay: it is a physically informed approximation that drives what is seen.
